ORDER I - PARTIES TO SUITS

Rule 10. Suit in name of wrong plaintiff
(1) Where a suit has been instituted in the name of the wrong person as plaintiff, or where it is doubtful whether it has been instituted in the name of the right plaintiff, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the right person to be substituted or added as plaintiff upon such terms as the Court thinks just.

ORDER VI - PLEADINGS GENERALLY
Rule 2. Pleadings to state material facts
